This FISHPACK library version 4.1 was written at NCAR by Paul N Swarztrauber, John Adams and 
Roland Sweet.

After you have downloaded fishpack4.1.tar.gz into a clean directory on your Unix or Linux system, 
execute these commands:

gunzip fishpack4.1.tar.gz 
tar xvf fishpack4.1.tar
cd fishpack/doc

Within that last directory fishpack/doc, follow instructions in README_FISHPACK4.1 for more information,
including the caveats.  Then use your browser to open and navigate FISHPACK4.1.html, following the links 
to view instructions for user-level routines.
