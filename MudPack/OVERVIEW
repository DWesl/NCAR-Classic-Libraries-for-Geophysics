This README file is specific to mudpack5.0.1 dated 2011-12-06. It was written at NCAR by
John Adams. This version is dentical with the one in 2011, except for changes in two
README files, including this one.

After you have downloaded mudpack5.0.1 into a clean directory on your Unix or Linux system, 
execute these commands:

gunzip mudpack5.0.1.tar.gz
tar xvf mudpack5.0.1.tar
cd mudpack5.0.1

Within that last directory mudpack5.0.1, follow instructions in the README_MUDPACK5.0.1 
file for more information.  Read the caveats in that file, about Fortran90 non-adherence, 
and the fact this library is older and best suited to applications in which it was 
previously used.

Also, in directory mudpack5.0.1, use your browser to open and navigate MUDPACK.html for 
more information about Mudpack, including support level (none) and usage instructions for 
each user-level routine.
