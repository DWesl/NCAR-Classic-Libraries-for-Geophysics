This spherepack3.2 library dated 2011-12-06 was written at NCAR by John Adams and Paul
Swarztrauber. This distribution is identical with the 2011-12-06 release except for 
changes in the README_SPHEREPACK3.2 file in the doc directory. Thus, the version level 
remains at 3.2.

After you have downloaded spherepack3.2 into a clean directory on your Unix or Linux system, 
execute these commands:

gunzip spherepack3.2.tar.gz
tar xvf spherepack3.2.tar
cd spherepack3.2

Within the spherepack3.2/doc directory, follow instructions in the README_SPHEREPACK3.2 
file.  Read the caveats in that file, then with your browser open SPHEREPACK3.2.html and
follow the links to view usage documentation for the user-level routines.
